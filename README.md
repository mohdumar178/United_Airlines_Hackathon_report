 This project focused on analyzing United Airlines' call center performance, specifically targeting metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST). The analysis included customer call data, sentiment analysis, and transcript evaluations to identify key drivers of long AHT and AST.

Key insights were uncovered by merging data on call reasons, sentiment, and agent performance. Additionally, an analysis of call transcripts identified common, self-solvable issues that could be addressed through enhancements to the IVR system.

Proposed solutions included simplifying the IVR menu, enabling self-service options for frequent issues, and integrating advanced NLP capabilities. These improvements aim to reduce agent workload, streamline operations, and enhance customer experience.

Tools Used: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), sentiment analysis
